November 1982Harvesting the Slack   You now have the notable distinction of being  the first major computing magazine to feature  computers in agriculture. Congratulations!?  Computing farmers have been around as long  as computing anybody else. Farming is as so-  phisticated a business as any other business; the  potential for farm computerization has never  been more potent. So where has everybody  been?   We realized over a year ago that the com-  puting farmer was going to be neglected, so last  winter we started our own full-fledged, farm-  computing magazine (not mentioned in your ar-  ticle). We now have readers all over the conti-  nent wanting to know the things nobody else  bothered to find out for them. Please tell your  readers (do you even know how many of them  are farmers?) that there's a magazine that pulls  up the slack you other guys left behind.
