November 1982One Reader's Good Reading   In reference to Ernie Brock of Sirius, whose let-  ter questioning Softalk's polling procedures for  Bestsellers appeared in the September issue Ñ I  say, more power to Softalk\ It seems that Mr.  Brock's capitalist dreams are influencing his  ideas, and Sirius Software too for that matter.  He certainly should research his accusations be-  fore making them.   While on the subject of Sirius, I think that  calling the people who sell Locksmith crooks is     way out in left field. What is really crooked is  charging five dollars for a replacement disk no  matter what the problem is. Come on, what  kind of policy is this? Perhaps Sirius and others  in the industry should take a look at what the  Carlston family is doing. I'm not even going to  bring up the Joyport fiasco.   Now, on another subject, I think Softalk  should print examples of what the programs  listed in the tutorials should look like when  they're run, if it's applicable. Either that, or a  very clear explanation of what's supposed to  happen when they're run. As it is, I'm not al-  ways sure if a program is running correctly, and  I'm almost positive that the shape maker pro-  gram isn't working properly.   Lastly, isn't that Bill Budge pictured at the  opening of Beginners' Comer, of all places?  Thomas E. Burns, Stevensville, MI   Bill Budge a beginner? Ridiculous! Or is it?  Let's ask our readers. Drop a postcard to Sof-  talk Budgie, Box 60, North Hollywood, CA  91603. If you think the "beginner" is Bill Budge,  write "It's him all right!" If you don't think it's  Budge, write "No way!" Also include your name  and address. If it is Budge, one person drawn  from all the yes cards will win a copy of the real  Bill Budge's new game { whenever it arrives). If it  isn't him, all no way answers will receive a set of  Softalk InvisiTabs Ñ and one person chosen at  random will still get a copy of Bill Budge's next  game.
