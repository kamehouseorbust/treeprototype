November 1982CATS in the Public Domain   In September Open Discussion Ellis McDan-  iels submitted an excellent letter stating the need  for freer exchange of information concerning  development of educational software. While I  am a speech-language pathologist and not a  teacher, users of microcomputers in rehabilita-  tive settings share many of the problems ex-  pressed by teachers such as Mr. McDaniels.   The purpose of this letter is to inform those  interested that the Audiology and Speech Pa-  thology Service at the Veterans Administration  Outpatient Clinic (425 South Hill Street, Los  Angeles, CA 90013) has developed a series of  reading treatment and testing programs on a  single disk for the Apple II Plus. These pro-  grams are collectively called CA TS {Computer-  ized Aphasia Treatment System) and can be list-  ed and copied; CA TS is not copyrighted and is  under public domain. While CA TS was written  for adults suffering from aphasia (a language  disorder resulting from brain injury), it is also  appropriate for younger people in need of read-  ing testing and treatment.   CATS is available free of charge. Anyone  interested in getting more information about  CA TS should write to me at the above address.  Richard C. Katz, Ph.D., Los Angeles, CA
